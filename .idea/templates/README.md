## ðŸ›  Live and File Templates

In addition to existing Intellij & AS templates, we have a couple of Aurora-specific templates to help us boost our productivity.

**Live Templates** - for code snippets [Jetbrains Docs](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/using-live-templates.html)

**Multi-File Templates** - for sets of files. We use [Freemarker](https://freemarker.apache.org/), the same technology Google is using for their Android templates in AS

Unfortunately, you have to import both of these template types manually.
See the [live template README](live/README.md) and [file template README](file/README.md) for further instructions.
